*******************
Generation of masks
*******************

This directory holds two scripts:

- the ``generate_point_sources_mask.py`` script generates a point sources mask file given a
configuration file.

- the ``generate_patches_mask.py`` script generates a set of patch masks *i.e.* region of the sky mask

For instance, you can run both scripts with the ``masks.dict`` dictionnary file as follow

.. code:: shell

    python generate_point_sources_mask.py masks.dict
